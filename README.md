Chef Effortless package which provides scheduling mechanism to run regular updates of an On-Prem Habitat Builder.

## Pre-Requisites

* Local Habitat On-Prem Builder server instance already running and configured - <https://github.com/habitat-sh/on-prem-builder>
* Habitat v0.90.10+ (To leverage seed-file toml structure introduced in `0.90.10`)
* Linux OS utilizing systemd for creation of systemd units to execute update scripts.
* Requires Internet connectivity to pull updates from public Habitat Builder, <https://bldr.habitat.sh>
* Personal Access Token for public Habitat Builder, <https://bldr.habitat.sh/>, to download packages.
* Personal Access Token for On-Prem Habitat Builder, allowing to upload new versions of packages which are downloaded from public Habitat Builder.

    ```text
    +-------------------+             +-------------------+
    |                   |             |                   |
    |  Chef Habitat     |------------>|  Chef Habitat     |

This repository contains both the Chef Habitat package and cookbook, following the Effortless (<https://www.chef.io/products/effortless-infrastructure/>) deployment pattern.  Installing and running the package generated by this repository will setup and configure a process by which an On-Prem Habitat Builder instance may be updated.

After package installation, the file `/hab/user/<origin>/hab_opbldr_update/user.toml` must be updated to indicate licence acceptance and for configuration of items under `[opbldr]` section:

```bash
# You must accept the Chef License to use this software: https://www.chef.io/end-user-license-agreement/
# Change [chef_license] from acceptance = "undefined" to acceptance = "accept-no-persist" if you agree to the license.

[chef_license]
acceptance = "undefined"
